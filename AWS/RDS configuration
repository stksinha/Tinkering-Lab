Requirement:
Create Publicly Accessible RDS Instance, Create Snapshot of RDS Instance, Enable Delete Protection for RDS Instance, Upgrade RDS MySQL Engine Version, Delete RDS Instance

==================
LET'S TINKER
==================

----------------------------------
Configuring RDS from AWS console
----------------------------------
====================
Create Publicly Accessible RDS Instance
====================
1. Go to Aurora and RDS ->Databases and click on 'Create Database'.
2. Select 'Full configuration' for full control of database configuration or 'Easy Create' for recommended configuration. Then choose the database engine type as per requirement (I have chosen MySQL).
3. Select the database engine version (from me, it is MySQL 8.4.5) and choose the template from Production, Dev/Test & Free Tier.(Type of available instances are dependent on the template). I am going with free tier.
4. Next is Availability & Durability. For free tier, only single-AZ deployment is available. For other template Multi-AZ DB cluster and DB instance available.
5. Provide the DB name, DB credentials like username & password and choose the instance (for me, db.t3.micro).
6. Select the storage type and provide the storage value as per requirement. Additional storage configuration incliudes Autoscaling of storage upto certain limit.
7. Choose Compute resource, Network type, VPC, DB Subnet group as per requirement and select Public access 'Yes' for Publicly accessible RDS instance.
8. Choose VPC Security Group, Availability zone, database authentication, monitoring as per requirement and click on 'Create database' at the bottom.
9. Wait for some time to get it in Available state.

====================
Create Snapshot of RDS Instance
====================
1. Go to Aurora and RDS ->Databases and select the database and click on Actions->Take snapshot
2. Select the Snapshot type like instance or cluster and choose the instance.
3. Provide a name of the snapshot and click on 'Take snapshot'
4. Wait for some time to get it in Available state in Aurora and RDS ->Snapshots.

====================
Enable Delete Protection for RDS Instance
====================
1. Go to Aurora and RDS ->Databases and select the database and click on Modify.
2. Go to Additional Configuration at the bottom and tick the 'Enable deletion protection box'. 
3. Click on Continue at the bottom and choose Schedule modifications (apply the modifications immediately or during next scheduled maintenance window) and click on 'Modify DB instance'.

====================
Upgrade RDS MySQL Engine Version
====================
1. Go to Aurora and RDS ->Databases and select the database and click on Modify.
2. Choose the new engine version and click on Continue at the bottom.
3. Choose Schedule modifications (apply the modifications immediately or during next scheduled maintenance window) and click on 'Modify DB instance'.
4. Wait for some time to get it in Available state.

====================
Delete RDS Instance
====================
1. Go to Aurora and RDS ->Databases and select the database and click on Actions->Delete.
2. Confirm deletion and click on Delete. (Uncheck the 'Create final snapshot' if not required before delete, else it will create a final snapshot before deletion; also uncheck the 'Retain automated backups' if not required as it is chargable for retaining the backups for 1 day post deletion; for these you need check the box for acknowledgement for not backup retention)
